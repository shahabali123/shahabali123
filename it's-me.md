👋 Hi, I’m @shahabali123

👀 I’m interested in building scalable and efficient web applications using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the industry.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced concepts in React, such as React Hooks and Context API, as well as improving my skills in backend development with Node.js and MongoDB.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve building complex web applications, such as e-commerce platforms, social media apps, or productivity tools. If you have an idea, let's work together to bring it to life!

📫 How to reach me: You can reach me through GitHub, or send me an email at shahab.mughal.180@gmail.com. I'm always open to discussing new projects or opportunities.

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I enjoy gardening and watching my plants grow.

Some of my notable projects include:

Personal Website: A responsive website built with React, showcasing my skills and experience. https://its-me-shahab.netlify.app/
Spotify Clone: A music streaming app built with HTML and CSS, using the Spotify API. https://shahabali123.github.io/spotify-clone/

Daraz Clone: An e-commerce platform built with HTML and CSS, responsive only on desktop. https://shahabali123.github.io/daraz-clone/

Feel free to explore my projects and let's connect! 😊
